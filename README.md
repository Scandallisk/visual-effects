# Legends of Aria Visual Effect Scripts
Community Server custom development feature that provides administrators with the ability to attach custom scripts to objects, decorations, equipment, pets, and even players.  I have recently made upwards of 63 different visual effects.

- This feature will consume extra memory on your server, please be advised.

- This feature can only be used by administrators.

#### Produced by SCAN from HOPE Society

## Installation Instructions

- To protect our community, please schedule downtime before deploying this change.

This code was produced for PublicServer version 1.4.7

### Download the files in this repository.

Next, add them to the following directory:

#### Path: base > scripts

## How to use these scripts:

1. Login as an administration character (GOD)
2. Right click on an object and select 'God Info'
3. Select the 'Behaviors' button.
4. Type the file name of one of the scripts you have downloaded.  (example - ai_effect_lightningbolt)
5. The visual effect loop will fire off and should begin displaying on the object.

### Notes from the developer

To test, I recommend you use temporary objects such as, spawning a decorative plant and attaching a visual-effect script to the plant.  If you are unsatisfied with the effect, you may /destroy the object and try again, or you may manually 'Remove' the script, pick up the object and the place it back on the ground and the effect will be gone.
